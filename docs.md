# Reference

XPCOM reference

- Overview - goals, issues, common pitfalls
- Best practices/patterns/idioms
- API reference
   - Index of core platform APIs - strings, XPCOM, file access etc
   - Index of firefox APIs
   - Index of TB APIs
   - Note clearly which ones are being phased out, and their replacements
   - Docs autogenerated from code where possible, but make sure not to overwhelm with detail.
   - Curated index of important APIs
   - Ongoing effort to improve/clarify docs.
     If you can't easily document an API, then it's probably too complicated :-)

C++ environment

- C++-specific APIs
- Coding style
- Thread safety rules
- Linting/static analysis tools

JS environment

- JS-specific API reference (eg OS.File et al)
- preferred idioms
  - async/await vs promises vs generators
  - modules (do we have our own module system or are we moving toward some existing standard?)
- coding style
  - to run linter to check
- GUI (eg are we shifting from XUL to more HTML-based?)

Testing

- unit tests
- mozmill/mochi/whatever
- how to run/write/debug tests

Tools

- mach
- linting
- testing

Source layout

Index of stuff which is deprecated/on the way out and what replaces it.
(eg using OS.File over nsIFile),

Curated index of interesting/useful blog posts/articles about TB development,
with some indication of relevance/staleness.

# Architecture

Concepts, intentions, aspirations.
JS/C++ split - where the boundaries should be.
Threading model
Plugin/extension model
