Notes on structure of various TB subsystems - mainly UML diagrams depicting
the various classes and interfaces involved.

Started off using graphviz .dot files to describe class diagrams, but switching
to plantUML.

Anything with `@startuml`...`@enduml` is a UML diagram to be run through plantUML.

    $ plantuml file.txt

produces .png by default.
